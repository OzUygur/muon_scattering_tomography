Muon tomography leverages cosmic muons' exceptional penetration capabilities to reconstruct detailed tomographic images via multiple Coulomb scattering interactions, making it invaluable for detecting High-Z materials critical to homeland security. This study introduces the Slope Intercept (SI) algorithm, a novel approach for rapid and precise tomographic image reconstruction. Implemented using Geant4 simulations in a standard-sized container tomography station, SI demonstrates superior performance in speed and simplicity compared to traditional methods. While the imaging results of SI and the Point of Closest Approach (POCA) algorithm are nearly identical, the SI algorithm is simpler to implement, requires shorter CPU time, and exhibits a smaller margin of error. Its computational efficiency and simplicity make it a robust alternative to the POCA algorithm. These findings highlight SI's suitability for applications demanding robust imaging and efficient data processing, which are crucial for advancing security measures and scientific research.
